              <p class="news-thumb__text">Familiar characters will return to the game, but also completely new ones. We are talking here about Thor, presented as a brutal and mentally unstable performer of "dirty work" in the services of Odin , as well as the ruler of the gods himself, who left his mark on the events of the previous installment, although he did not appear in it personally.</p>
